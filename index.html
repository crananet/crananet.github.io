<h3>Olympia Candidate Forum October 4th</h3>
Come meet the eight city council candidates and hear how they propose to address the issues important to our neighborhoods. Along with an informal meet and greet, candidates will introduce themselves and then participate in a moderated forum to give us all a better understanding of where they stand on the issues and how they propose to resolve them.
<br><br>
In addition, Mayor Selby will provide information on the City's public safety initiative and a Home Fund representative will speak on the affordable housing initiative. These initiatives will appear on the November and February ballots, respectively. 
<br><br>
You can submit your question to the candidates using the link below until October 1st.
