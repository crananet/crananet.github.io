To date, CRANA residents have donated over **$190,000** in food to the Thurston County Food Bank. 

To participate, simply place food donations in a green bag on your front porch on the morning of a pick up date and a volunteer will come collect it. Don't have a green bag? <a href='&#109;&#97;&#105;lto&#58;m&#98;%5&#70;c%6C&#105;n&#101;&#64;&#99;%6F%6Dc%61&#115;&#37;74&#46;n&#101;t'>E-mail us</a> and we'll get you one!

Want to participate **even more**? You can come meet your neighbors and sort out food at Pioneer Middle School on the pick up dates between 10am-12pm.

Thanks to the residents of CRANA, the December food drive brought in **$5,502** worth of food! Thank you to everyone who made that possible!

We need Neighborhood Coordinators.  To be one, simply organize a few (one or more) of your neighbors as participants, get bags from the Steering Committee and let your folks know of the pick up schedule, then pick up and deliver the bags on the day of collection.  This takes less than one hour every two months and is a valuable and fun service. 

Not sure what food to give? The food bank will take almost any kind of non-perishable food items. Here are some ideas for things to get for each month.

* December - Canned protein (tuna, chicken, stews, spam, etc. lentils, beans, peanut butter)
* February - Canned fruit
* April - Canned soups-donâ€™t forget vegetarians
* June - PB/Mac and cheese, quick summer kid lunches
* August - Backpack program-stocking up for back to school bags-easy open.
* October - Canned pumpkin and canned sweet potatoes
