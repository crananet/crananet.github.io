Speeding, discourteous drivers? Encouraging folks to slow down the pace might be another way to go.

Traffic calming devices and strategies are often the first thing people think of when they notice cars speeding by. Speed bumps, roundabouts, rumble strips, all have their place in the traffic engineer's tool box. But those things aren't always appropriate, acceptable, and affordable. What can we do as neighbors to discourage driving too fast and bring about the kind of change where more, not fewer, pedestrians and cyclists, young and old, enjoy walking and biking in the neighborhood we all call home?

If you care about this issue and want to become involved, please <a href='m&#97;i&#108;to&#58;dpan%74%65l%6&#57;s&#37;32&#55;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#37;&#54;1%6&#57;l&#46;%63om'>send me an e-mail</a>. We'll start with a meeting to discuss strategies and ideas. We will look to one another to make things happen.

For now, you can be a traffic calming device simply by slowing down the pace.
