The concept of a walking school bus is fairly simple. Kids and a few parents walk together as a group to school each day. The benefits?

* Greater visibility of a group adds safety
* Parents get to know other families attending the neighborhood school
* Building community
* Getting a bit of exercise
* Zero-emissions
* Fun social time before school
* Minds awake and ready to learn
* Reduced number of vehicles in a school zone

Convinced or curious to learn more? <a href='m&#97;i&#108;to&#58;dpan%74%65l%6&#57;s&#37;32&#55;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#37;&#54;1%6&#57;l&#46;%63om'>Send me an e-mail</a> and I can connect you with parents that are already doing this.

Thanks!
