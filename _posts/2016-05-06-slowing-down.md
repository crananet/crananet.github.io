### Let's make CRANA safe and healthy  

I don’t think we realize just how fast we go
Whether off to work
On an errand
Or simply trying to get home
 
We hurry up
We get impatient
In our rush from here to there
 
But when you’re here, you’re almost home
So take a breath
Ease off the gas
And slow it down some more
 
 
We all want to keep our neighborhood streets and walkways a safe and healthy place to be.  There’s much we can work on together, but each of us can be a very effective traffic calming device just by the way we drive.
 
Oh, and to those who might protest and argue that 25 mph is too slow, try a walk and see if you can’t feel the difference when a speeding car passes you by.
